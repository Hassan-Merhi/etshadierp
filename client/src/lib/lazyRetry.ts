/**
 * React.lazy that retries the dynamic import before giving up.
 *
 * A page chunk that fails to arrive — a dropped connection, a request the
 * browser cancelled, a slow proxy — rejects with "Failed to fetch dynamically
 * imported module". main.tsx treats that as a stale-asset build and recovers by
 * reloading the whole page, which is right after a deploy and far too heavy for
 * a blip: the user loses their place for a chunk that would have arrived on a
 * second try.
 *
 * Retrying first keeps a transient failure invisible — the chunk simply loads a
 * moment later. A chunk that is genuinely gone still exhausts its attempts and
 * still reaches the recovery path, so deploys behave exactly as before.
