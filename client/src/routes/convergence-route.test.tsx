/**
 * The convergence report is reachable, and only by who may read it.
 *
 * The reconciler shipped as an endpoint with no route pointing at it, which is
 * the same as not shipping it: nobody runs curl against their own books. This
 * mounts the real route table and asserts the page is served at its path.
 *
 * It also asserts the gate matches the endpoint's own. The route answers to
 * requireRole("Admin", "Owner") — Developer passes through requireRole
 * unconditionally — so a client gate any wider would advertise a page in the
 * command palette that answers 403 to everyone who found it, and a gate any
 * narrower would hide a report from someone the server is happy to serve.
