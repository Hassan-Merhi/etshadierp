/**
 * The palette does not offer a command that navigates somewhere else.
 *
 * `adminPages` is shown in both the ERP and the factory shell, but the pages it
 * lists are registered in ErpRoutes only. Under a factory-type company the
 * route guard redirects any unprefixed path to the factory default page, so
 * selecting one of those commands silently lands the user somewhere they did
 * not ask for — which is worse than the command not being there, because it
 * looks like the feature is broken rather than absent.
 *
 * Entries carrying `erpShellOnly` are therefore dropped outside the ERP shell.
 * These tests pin both halves: present where it works, absent where it does
 * not. Several older admin entries have the same problem and are not yet
 * marked; that is a pre-existing gap, and the point of this test is that the
 * mechanism for closing it keeps working as entries are verified.
