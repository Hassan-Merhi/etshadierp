/**
 * verify-dependency-audit.mjs
 *
 * Fails the build on any high or critical vulnerability in the production
 * dependency tree, except for advisories explicitly accepted below.
 *
 * This replaces a bare `npm audit --audit-level=critical`, which let every
 * high-severity finding through silently because npm has no way to accept a
 * single advisory. Here an exception must be written down, justified, and
 * given a review date — so "we looked at it and accepted it" and "nobody has
 * looked at it" stop being indistinguishable.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/verify-dependency-audit.mjs [--include-dev]
 *
 * By default only the production tree is audited, matching what actually ships.
 * --include-dev widens it to build and test tooling, for the scheduled sweep.

 * Vulnerabilities we have reviewed and accepted, keyed by package name.

 * Every entry needs:
 *   reason    — why this is not exploitable here, or why we cannot act yet
 *   reviewOn  — YYYY-MM-DD to re-check; the build warns once this passes
 *
 * An entry is NOT a way to silence a finding you have not investigated. If
 * an upstream fix appears, this script tells you to drop the exception.
