# ERP POS System
A comprehensive ERP and POS system for multi-company warehouse management, optimizing operations, inventory, and financials, with an AI Chatbot for intelligent assistance.

## Run & Operate
- **Run Development**: `npm run dev` (client and server)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Typecheck**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit CLI for schema migrations. Runtime migrations are handled via an array in `server/index.ts`.
- **Environment Variables**:
    - `CSRF_ENFORCE`: "0" for warn-only, anything else (default) for hard 403.
    - `NODE_ENV`: "development" or "production".

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, `react-hook-form` with Zod, `wouter` (routing), `shadcn/ui` (Tailwind CSS, Radix UI).
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Zod (validation), `pg` (PostgreSQL driver), Drizzle ORM.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Build Tool**: Vite.

## Where things live
- **Client Source**: `client/src/`
    - **Pages**: `client/src/pages/` (categorized into `factory/`, `pos/`, `properties/`, and root for shared ERP pages)
    - **Components**: `client/src/components/` (shared UI primitives)
    - **Contexts**: `client/src/contexts/`
    - **Hooks**: `client/src/hooks/`
    - **Lib**: `client/src/lib/` (utilities, API clients, offline logic)
- **Server Source**: `server/`
    - **Routes**: `server/routes/` (categorized into `factory/` and root for ERP routes)
    - **Lib**: `server/lib/` (helpers, PDF generators, date utilities)
- **Shared Code**: `shared/`
    - **Database Schema**: `shared/schema.ts` (source of truth for DB structure and types)
- **Public Assets**: `client/public/` (service worker, label images)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` (database backfills, CSRF smoke tests)

## Architecture decisions
- **Full-stack TypeScript**: Enhances type safety from database schema to frontend UI.
- **Drizzle ORM for Schema and Queries**: Provides type-safe database interactions and schema management. Runtime migrations are managed via a dedicated array, ensuring idempotent schema updates.
- **Offline-First with IndexedDB**: Utilizes Dexie.js and a robust sync engine for resilience against network outages, including conflict resolution and draft autosave.
- **Multi-Tenancy and Modularity**: Supports `erp`, `factory`, and `properties` company types with isolated data, API namespaces, and UI components, sharing core accounting.
- **Shared UI Primitives (`shadcn/ui`)**: Enforces visual consistency and improves developer velocity by providing a canonical set of reusable UI components.
- **Centralized `adjustInventory` Helper**: All inventory mutations are routed through a single helper with row-level locking and cost calculations for data integrity.

## User preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Testing: do not add new test files unless absolutely necessary; only update existing tests if they break because of a change. For verification, run typecheck/build and manually explain what was checked instead of expanding the test suite.

## Gotchas
- **`tsc --noEmit` duration**: Typechecking can take longer than 2 minutes, making in-loop verification difficult.
- **Orphaned data**: Several `NOT VALID` foreign key constraints exist due to historical orphaned rows. Applying these as `VALIDATE` would require data cleanup decisions.
- **`console.log` usage**: Server-side code still contains many `console.log` calls; use `serverLog` for production logging.
- **`drizzle-kit push`**: Currently blocked by schema drift; direct SQL in `server/index.ts` is the active migration method.
