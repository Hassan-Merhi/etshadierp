# Properties Mode Navigation Registry

## Purpose

This document is the authoritative navigation contract for the Properties company shell. It records every routed Properties screen, normal entry point, permission boundary, deterministic parent, Escape target, visible Back target, direct-link behavior, and compatibility exception.

The audit is navigation-only. It does not change rental, property, voucher, accounting, ledger, analytics, or administrative business logic.

## Shell and fallback behavior

| Concern | Final behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Company shell | A company with `companyType === "properties"` renders `PropertiesShell`. |
| Canonical namespace | All normal Properties workspace routes live under `/properties/*`. |
| Historical aliases | `/my-settings` and `/balance-repair` redirect to their canonical Properties routes with replacement history when a Properties company is selected. |
| Wrong-mode route | A Properties company entering a non-Properties route is redirected to `/properties/daybook` with replacement history. |
| Unknown Properties route | The Properties route switch redirects to `/properties/daybook` with replacement history. |
| Unauthorized Properties route | Permission-gated route components are not mounted; the route falls through safely to `/properties/daybook`. |
| Root Back behavior | Root pages do not expose arbitrary browser-history Back behavior. |

## Final sidebar structure

### Pinned daily work

| Label | Route | Permission | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Daybook | `/properties/daybook` | Properties user | Root |
| Agent Ledger | `/properties/agents` | Properties user | Root |

### Rentals

| Label | Canonical route | Permission | Parent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Payments Log | `/properties/rentals?tab=payments` | Properties user | Root hub tab |
| Cash Transfer | `/properties/transfer` | Developer only | Rentals hub |

Legacy rental URLs remain supported and redirect with replacement history:

- `/properties/rental/warehouses` → `/properties/rentals`
- `/properties/rental/shops` → `/properties/rentals?tab=shops`

## Back, Escape, and browser history contract

1. Close the newest open dialog, menu, popover, command palette, or layered control first.
2. Do not navigate away while an editable control is actively handling Escape.
3. On child pages, Escape and visible Back use the same deterministic parent.
4. Root pages do not expose a Back action based only on browser history.
5. Hub tab changes replace history instead of adding repetitive entries.
6. Direct links to valid child screens remain supported.
7. Invalid and retired aliases canonicalize with replacement history.
8. Unknown or unauthorized routes land safely on Properties Daybook.

## Permission contract

| Role | Expected Properties navigation access |
| --- | --- |
| Regular Properties user | Daily work, Rentals, Accounts, Vouchers, Analytics, My Settings |
| Admin | Regular access plus Properties Settings and admin repair/diagnostic routes |
| Developer | Admin access plus Company Cash Transfer |

Unauthorized routes must not mount hidden page content before redirecting to a safe permitted Properties page.

## Remaining phase

### Phase 5 — final regression verification

- Verify direct entry, Back, Forward, Escape, visible Back, permissions, and unknown routes.
- Reconcile the branch with the latest `main`.
- Confirm the final diff remains navigation-only before merge.
