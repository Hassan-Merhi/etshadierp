## Database

- **PostgreSQL 16** is the certified production and CI baseline.
- Versioned SQL and idempotent startup migrations manage persistent databases.
- `drizzle-kit push` is limited to disposable CI/test databases; never use it to
  update a persistent or production database.

---

## Environment

- Linux is the production and CI runtime (`ubuntu-24.04` for final certification).
- Windows is supported for the packaged desktop application; use WSL2 for local
  server development.
- Required and optional environment variables are documented in `.env.example`.
