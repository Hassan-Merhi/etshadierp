# Documentation

Everything in this directory describes **how the system behaves now**. Anything
that describes finished work — a phase write-up, a completion record, a dated
audit — lives in [`archive/`](archive/) and is history, not reference.

That split is enforced, not conventional: `npm run audit:doc-index` fails on a
doc with no classification, a stale classification row, a record filed outside
the archive, a current reference missing from this landing page, or a bound
figure that has drifted from the config it describes. See Phase 3 of
[`system-quality-program.md`](system-quality-program.md).

Every current reference document except this README must be linked from this
page. Adding a reference without adding it here is a documentation-state audit
failure, so a correct document cannot quietly become undiscoverable.

## `archive/`

Historical documents recording work that finished: phase write-ups, completion
records, dated audits, and per-program verification reports. They are kept
because they explain *why* decisions were made, and they are accurate as of the
day they were written — but nothing in there should be read as a description of
current behaviour.

New phase documents are written straight into `archive/`. Only material that
describes lasting behaviour gets promoted out, and promoting one means
reclassifying it in `config/doc-index.json` — which is the moment to check that
it is actually still true.
