/**
 * Response pins for the six route files whose bulk is a single handler.
 *
 * These are the last of the Phase 3 monoliths, and the route manifest cannot
 * carry them: it proves a route is still *registered* after a change, not that
 * the handler still computes the same figures. Reducing these files means
 * extracting logic from inside the handler, so the figures are exactly what is
 * at risk - and they are net profit, supplier statements and purchase orders.
 *
 * So each endpoint's response is hashed against a seeded fixture and pinned
 * here. Extract freely; if a number moves, this fails.
 *
 *   Regenerate (only after a *deliberate* behaviour change):
 *     UPDATE_REPORT_CHARACTERIZATION=1 npm run test:backend -- report-endpoint
 *
 * Volatile fields (ids, timestamps, generated filenames) are stripped before
 * hashing - see normalize() - because they differ per seed and would make the
 * pin useless rather than strict.
