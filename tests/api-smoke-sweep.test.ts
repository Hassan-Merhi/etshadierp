/**
 * API smoke sweep.
 * ---------------
 * Companion to `api-smoke.test.ts`, which hand-checks response *contracts* for
 * ~30 important endpoints. This file instead checks *liveness* across the whole
 * read surface: every parameterless `GET /api/...` route in the committed route
 * manifest is called once as an authenticated admin and must not return 5xx.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside the route manifest:
 *
 *   - The manifest proves a route is still *registered* after a file split. It
 *     cannot prove the handler still *works* — a helper that moved without
 *     being re-exported, or a circular import that resolves to `undefined` at
 *     call time, registers fine and throws only when the handler executes.
 *   - This sweep executes them, so that class of split damage surfaces
 *     immediately instead of in production.
 *
 * Endpoints that legitimately fail without richer seed data are recorded in
 * `config/api-smoke-baseline.json`. That list is a ratchet: entries may be
 * removed as endpoints are fixed or seeding improves, but adding to it means
 * accepting a known-broken endpoint and requires review.
