/**
 * Behavioural coverage for the employee advance and bonus write routes.
 *
 * All five were guard-only. Advances track money lent to an employee and repaid
 * over time; bonuses post a journal and move the employee's running balance.
 *
 * The properties that carry the risk:
 *
 *   - **Repayment arithmetic.** `remaining_balance` falls by exactly the amount
 *     repaid, is clamped at zero rather than going negative, and `fully_paid`
 *     flips precisely when the balance reaches zero. An over-repayment that
 *     drove the balance negative would show the company owing the employee.
 *   - **A bonus moves three things together.** The voucher (Dr payroll expense
 *     / Cr employee), `employees.current_balance` and `employees.total_deposits`
 *     all move by the same amount. Deleting the bonus has to put all three
 *     back — a reversal that dropped the voucher but left the balance would
 *     leave the employee permanently owed money with nothing behind it.
 *   - **Deletes take their dependents.** Removing an advance removes its
 *     repayments; removing a bonus removes its voucher and both entries.
 *
 * The bonus voucher credits an entry keyed by `employee_id` with a null
 * `ledger_account_id`, which is how this schema represents an employee-side
 * leg. The balance assertion is written against the totals rather than the
 * account, so it holds regardless of how that leg is modelled.
