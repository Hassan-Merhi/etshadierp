/**
 * Behavioural coverage for the factory worker advance write routes.
 *
 * All four were guard-only. An advance is a loan to a worker: giving one posts
 * Dr "Factory Worker Advances" / Cr cash and starts a balance that later
 * payroll runs deduct against, so the two numbers that matter are the voucher
 * legs and `remaining_balance`.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *
 *   - **The posting balances and runs the right way.** An advance is an asset —
 *     money the worker owes back — so the advances account is debited and cash
 *     credited. Reversed, it would look like the company had been paid.
 *   - **`remaining_balance` starts at the full amount.** Payroll deducts from
 *     this. Starting it at zero silently forgives the loan; starting it high
 *     over-deducts from wages.
 *   - **No cash account means no voucher.** An advance can be recorded without
 *     picking one, and in that case nothing may reach the ledger at all — a
 *     half-posted voucher would be a one-sided entry.
 *   - **Delete and reverse are different operations.** Reverse restores the
 *     advance to fully outstanding and drops its repayments; delete removes the
 *     advance, its repayments and the voucher behind it. Neither may leave a
 *     `voucher_entries` row without its voucher.
 *   - **Both are Admin-only**, and the role check must come before any write.
 *
 * Note on an unrelated wart found while reading: the daybook writes here pass
 * `parseInt(req.session.userId)` into an integer `created_by`, and `users.id`
 * is a UUID — `parseInt` stops at the first non-digit and stores a truncated
 * number rather than failing. It records a meaningless attribution rather than
 * corrupting money, so it is left alone and noted here rather than changed.
