/**
 * Guard sweep over the sensitive write surface.
 *
 * The API smoke sweep proves the read surface still responds. It cannot do the
 * same for writes — calling a mutating endpoint in a sweep would post vouchers
 * and move stock — so `tests/api-smoke-sweep.test.ts` excludes them by design,
 * and `npm run audit:write-routes` exists to measure the hole that leaves.
 *
 * There is exactly one thing that can be asserted about every write route
 * without writing anything: an unauthenticated caller must be turned away.
 * That request is rejected by the guard chain before the handler runs, so the
 * sweep is safe on endpoints a read sweep could never touch, and the property
 * is worth holding — a route registered without `requireAuth` is a hole in the
 * ledger that nothing else in this repository would notice.
 *
 * What this sweep is NOT is behavioural coverage. It says nothing about whether
 * a route computes the right numbers. `audit-write-route-coverage.mjs` counts
 * routes covered only by this file separately, under
 * `guardOnlySensitiveCeiling`, so that "referenced by a test" cannot quietly
 * come to mean "swept". Phase F draws that second number down by giving these
 * routes real tests; a route leaves the guard-only set as soon as any other
 * test names it.
 *
 * The inventory below is written out rather than derived from the manifest at
 * runtime, for two reasons: the coverage audit looks for path literals in test
 * sources, and an explicit list is reviewable in a diff. The first test keeps
 * it honest by requiring it to equal the audit's sensitive set exactly, so a
 * new sensitive write route fails here until it is listed.
