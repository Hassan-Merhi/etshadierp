/**
 * Guard sweep over the sensitive write surface.
 *
 * The API smoke sweep proves the read surface still responds. It cannot do the
 * same for writes — calling a mutating endpoint in a sweep would post vouchers
 * and move stock — so `tests/api-smoke-sweep.test.ts` excludes them by design,
 * and `npm run audit:write-routes` exists to measure the hole that leaves.
 *
 * There is exactly one thing that can be asserted about every write route
 * without writing anything: an unauthenticated caller must be turned away.
 * That request is rejected by the guard chain before the handler runs, so the
 * sweep is safe on endpoints a read sweep could never touch, and the property
 * is worth holding — a route registered without `requireAuth` is a hole in the
 * ledger that nothing else in this repository would notice.
 *
 * What this sweep is NOT is behavioural coverage. It says nothing about whether
 * a route computes the right numbers. `audit-write-route-coverage.mjs` counts
 * routes covered only by this file separately, under
 * `guardOnlySensitiveCeiling`, so that "referenced by a test" cannot quietly
 * come to mean "swept". Phase F draws that second number down by giving these
 * routes real tests; a route leaves the guard-only set as soon as any other
 * test names it.
 *
 * Four worker-deduction routes briefly left this list when
 * server/routes/payroll/workerStatsAdvancesRoutes.ts was split. They write
 * factory_worker_deductions only, and the audit classifies by owner file, so
 * sharing a 936-line file with the voucher-posting advance routes had been
 * lending them a sensitivity they did not declare themselves.
 *
 * Rather than accept the narrower set, factory_worker_deductions was added to
 * SENSITIVE_TABLES. A payroll deduction reduces what a worker is paid, and
 * reaching the ledger through a payroll voucher rather than directly does not
 * make it less real. Both zero ceilings still hold at the wider set, so the
 * coverage was already there — only the classification was wrong.
 *
 * Two stock-transfer-revision routes left this list when the revision lifecycle
 * became immutable. DELETE /api/stock-transfer-revisions/:id and
 * PATCH /api/stock-transfer-revisions/:id/optional are now answered by the
 * tombstones in server/routes/vouchers/immutableStockTransferRevisionRoutes.ts,
 * which are registered first and reject every call with 409 before any write.
 * The approve handler that used to adjust inventory from
 * server/routes/fiscal-transfers/revisions-write.ts moved to
 * services/immutableStockTransferRevisionLifecycle, so the owner file no longer
 * writes a sensitive table. Unlike the worker deductions above, narrowing is
 * right here: these two routes can no longer write anything at all.
 *
 * The inventory below is written out rather than derived from the manifest at
 * runtime, for two reasons: the coverage audit looks for path literals in test
 * sources, and an explicit list is reviewable in a diff. The first test keeps
 * it honest by requiring it to equal the audit's sensitive set exactly, so a
 * new sensitive write route fails here until it is listed.

/**
 * Routes the audit no longer classifies as sensitive, but which still write
 * bales, orders and daybook entries through a sibling module.
 *
 * Phase 3 moved each of these endpoints' whole transaction into a `*Atomic`
 * module beside its route file so the proforma-capacity and physical-bale locks
 * commit with the rest of the write. The audit classifies by the registering
 * file's own text, so the extraction took them out of its sensitive set — but
 * unlike the retired stock-transfer-revision routes above, these still write
 * exactly what they wrote before. Narrowing the sweep to match the audit would
 * drop the one assertion that holds for them, so they are swept explicitly.
 *
 * The stock-adjustment and waste-dispatch routes joined them when Phase 5 made
 * stock-adjustment totals atomic: server/routes/stockAdjustmentWasteRoutes.ts
 * now hands its writes to stockAdjustmentCreateHandler and storage, so its own
 * text no longer names a sensitive table, but the routes still move stock.
 *
 * POST /api/sales-report/recalculate-costs left the sensitive list outright, as
 * the stock-transfer-revision routes did: historical sale costs are immutable,
 * and the route now answers 409 HISTORICAL_SALE_COST_IMMUTABLE without writing.
 *
 * PATCH and DELETE /api/factory/payroll/:id and POST /api/factory/payroll/:id/undo
 * joined them in wave 7 (2026-10-09):
 * the payment voucher of a payroll marked PAID, and its removal on un-mark or
 * undo, moved to services/payroll/factoryPayrollPaymentVoucher.ts, so the route
 * file no longer names the voucher tables itself; the routes still post them.
 *
 * The factory V3 load routes joined them in wave 17 B: the load finalize (bales
 * SOLD, the invoice and its journal) moved to services/factory/v3LoadInvoice.ts,
 * so the route file no longer names the bale tables; the routes still write them.
