/**
 * Behavioural coverage for the customer-order charge write routes.
 *
 * All four were guard-only. Each of them mutates `customer_order_charges` and
 * then re-derives the order's stored totals, and those totals are what the
 * customer is invoiced from.
 *
 * The invariant is arithmetic and exact, so it is worth asserting rather than
 * approximating:
 *
 *     grand_total = subtotal_bales + freight_amount + other_charges_total
 *
 * with charges bucketed into freight or other by `charge_type`. Every one of
 * these endpoints calls `recalculateOrderTotals` after its write, so a charge
 * that lands in the wrong bucket, or a recalculation that is skipped on one
 * path, leaves the order's grand total disagreeing with the charges attached to
 * it — and both numbers still look plausible on their own.
 *
 * These orders carry no bales, so `subtotal_bales` is zero throughout and the
 * grand total is exactly the charges. That keeps the assertion on the part
 * these routes are responsible for.
