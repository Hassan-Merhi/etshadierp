/**
 * Wraps a scheduled job so a slow run cannot be overtaken by the next tick.
 *
 * node-cron fires on the clock, not on completion: an hourly job that takes
 * seventy minutes is already running when the next hour arrives, and the daily
 * export deliberately waits fifteen minutes between retries, so this is not a
 * theoretical case. Without a guard the runs pile up — each one re-reading the
 * same due work, competing for the same connections, and reporting durations
 * that no longer mean anything.
 *
 * The guard is per process. It is not a distributed lock and does not pretend to
 * be one: jobs whose work must not be repeated across processes claim their work
 * in the database (the location report claims the calendar day, the daily export
 * checks whether today's run is already in flight). This closes the much more
 * common case of one process tripping over its own previous tick.
 *
 * A skipped tick is logged rather than dropped silently, because a job that is
 * always still running is a problem someone needs to see.
