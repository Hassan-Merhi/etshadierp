/**
 * Shared pricing-basis resolver for factory mix-batch source rows.

 * CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE (spec §3 / §C):
 *   supplierId takes priority over containerId.
 *   A source row that has both supplierId and containerId was created by the
 *   FIFO per-container stock deduction path. The containerId is only FIFO
 *   provenance/quantity attribution. The cost basis is the supplier locked
 *   rate immediately before that batch consumption — NOT the individual
 *   container's own landed rate.
 *
 * Use this resolver everywhere a cost basis decision is made: cascade,
 * mismatch preview, historical replay, and display surfaces.
