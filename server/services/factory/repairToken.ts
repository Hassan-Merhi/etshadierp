/**
 * Generic signed, expiring confirmation-token helper for admin repair flows
 * (raw-material FX resolution, raw-stock recalculation, and any future
 * "preview now / apply later" financial repair endpoint).
 *
 * A token is NOT just an opaque hash of a few fields — it's a base64url JSON
 * payload plus an HMAC signature (keyed by SESSION_SECRET, the same signing
 * key already used elsewhere in this codebase for session/security tokens).
 * This lets the payload carry an arbitrary, explicit set of bound fields
 * (companyId, source, row id, new value, old stored value, old confirmed
 * state, a version/timestamp column, the requesting user/session, and an
 * expiry) and lets the verifier recover those fields WITHOUT needing a
 * separate server-side store — the token itself is self-describing and
 * tamper-evident.
 *
 * Verification only proves the token was issued by this server for exactly
 * this payload and has not expired. It is the CALLER's job to also re-derive
 * the current state fresh from the database and compare it against the
 * embedded old-value/version fields — that's what catches a "stale" token
 * (issued against a row that has since changed).
