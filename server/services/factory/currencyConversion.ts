 * a stored value of exactly 1 is therefore indistinguishable from "nobody
 * ever explicitly set this" — a genuine 1:1 peg against USD does not occur
 * for this business's supplier currencies (USD/EUR/CDF etc.). This exact
 * "looks set" heuristic already existed ad hoc in rawStockOffloadRoutes.ts;
 * this module makes it the one shared, tested implementation. Every place
 * that derives a USD cost/kg (or any USD amount) from an original-currency
 * value and a stored/fallback exchange rate must go through here instead of
 * inlining `parseFloat(x || "1")`, so a genuinely unresolved rate is never
 * silently treated as 1.

 * and factory_container_commissions) — this is the source of truth and a confirmed
 * rate of exactly 1 IS valid. `confirmed` is `undefined` for tables that don't carry
 * the column yet (e.g. factory_supplier_payments, factory_raw_stock commission fields,
 * factory_daybook_entries) — for those we fall back to the legacy "rate>0 && rate!==1"
 * heuristic as a stopgap, which is a known imprecision (a genuine confirmed 1.0 rate on
 * those tables would still be flagged unresolved) until they get the same column.
