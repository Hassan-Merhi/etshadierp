/**
 * The voucher-path boundary stores the response of a state-changing accounting
 * request and replays it verbatim when the same request identity arrives again.
 * What it stores comes from `captureResponse`, so if that captures the wrong
 * shape every retry of a `/api/sp/` write — a POS sale, a Fresh Start payment,
 * a HADI remittance — answers with a body the original caller never saw.
 *
 * Express implements `res.json(value)` by serializing and delegating to
 * `res.send(string)`. A capture that records both therefore ends up holding the
 * JSON text rather than the object, and the replay returns a JSON-encoded
 * string. These tests pin the structured value.
