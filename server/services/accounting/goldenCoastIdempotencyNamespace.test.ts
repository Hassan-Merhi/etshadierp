/**
 * Golden Coast Phase 16 — no duplicate journals.
 *
 * `accounting_posting_requests` carries a unique index on
 * (company_id, idempotency_key), so a repeated key is a replay that returns the
 * original voucher and a fresh key posts a new one. Two failures follow from
 * that, and neither is visible to a single phase's own tests:
 *
 *   * two DIFFERENT events sharing a key — the second silently replays the
 *     first and its journal is never posted, and
 *   * one event producing an UNSTABLE key — a retry posts a duplicate journal.
 *
 * This suite drives every Golden Coast key builder together and checks both
 * properties across the whole programme namespace.
