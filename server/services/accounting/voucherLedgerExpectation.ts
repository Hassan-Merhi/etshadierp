/**
 * What ledger evidence a voucher type owes.
 *
 * Convergence reconciliation started from one assumption — every voucher posts
 * a balanced double entry whose sides each equal the document total — and that
 * is not true for every persisted document shape. Each type states what it
 * actually posts, and a type nobody has classified is reported rather than
 * quietly skipped.
 *
 * "balanced"        Debits equal credits, and each side equals the document total.
 * "balanced-only"   Debits equal credits, but the document header is not the
 *                   ledger-side total. Credit/Debit Notes are the important case:
 *                   the refund/receipt header can differ from inventory cost and
 *                   the variance account makes the ledger balance at cost value.
 * "single-sided"    Exactly one GL side is posted and inventory is the contra
 *                   side; or, once the company's perpetual-inventory cut-over
 *                   applies, the voucher also carries its inventory line and
 *                   both sides are posted and equal.
 * "inventory-sided" One or both GL sides can be posted and inventory carries the
 *                   net contra. Mixed production/consumption documents use this.
 * "none"            The document posts no ledger entry at all; stock evidence is
 *                   reconciled separately.
