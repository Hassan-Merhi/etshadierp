/**
 * Startup-migration outcome, readable by the health surface.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `runMigrations()` collected its failures in a local array, logged them at
 * ERROR, and then set `migrationsDone = true` in a `finally` regardless of the
 * outcome. `/api/health/db` reported `{"status":"ok","message":"Database
 * ready"}` off that flag alone, so a startup with fifteen failed migrations was
 * indistinguishable from a clean one.
 *
 * That mattered because `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gates the entire backend
 * suite on that endpoint (`if: steps.runtime_migrations.outcome == 'success'`),
 * and the step succeeds as soon as the endpoint answers. A broken migration
 * therefore passed CI silently — the tests ran against whatever schema
 * survived.
 *
 * The failures stay non-fatal: the server is deliberately built to start and
 * serve against a partial schema rather than refuse traffic, and that behaviour
 * is not changed here. What changes is that the outcome is now reported, so a
 * gate can be built on it.
